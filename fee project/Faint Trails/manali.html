    <h2>why we Love Manali?</h2>
    <p>Manali is very well known for its posh cafes that serve cuisines ranging from Italian to Northeastern. A locally brewed rice beer called Lugdi takes a little time to develop a taste for, but once you do, you’ll thank us. 
        Calling out all true-blue hikers, Manali not only has so much to please your eyes, but also your thirst for adventure. A number of hikes cater to a plethora of travellers who are intrigued by the mighty mountains and nature’s glory. Among these, Jogini Waterfall Trek, Hampta Pass Trek, Patalsu Peak, Parashar lake are some of the famous ones.
        The river Beas runs through this town, making every turn and narrow climb blissful. Soak your feet and submit to the cold waters of the river for hours at a time. And the best part, you won't have to go far for it.

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>The town is named after saint Manu, who came here to meditate and re-create human life after it was tragically washed out in the great Himalayan floods. The saint is a local legend and his temple is still revered by the locals.
        It is said that every local family/resident in Manali owns at least one apple tree, amidst other vegetation. The soil here yields a high quality of fruits and vegetables, all thanks to the Beas River. In peak season, blossoms of cherry, apple, peach, and apricot trees bloom, painting the town delicate and mesmerising.
        Unlike other places in India, where temples are made for Gods and their helpers alike, Manali happens to have a temple dedicated to a demon. The Goddess Hidimba was the demon wife of Bhima and has the Hidimba temple to her name.
