    <h1>Welcome to Jaisalmer !</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Jaisalmer is golden in the most profound sense, with the colour reflecting in its houses, streets, and desert alike. Travellers look forward to a lip-smacking plate of daal baati, walking through a fort which is a city in itself, and exploring the textiles to bring home a skirt or a mat. Accompanying these, Jaisalmer gives you a surreal experience of camping in the desert, watching the stars swoosh over your head and meeting the sun as it rises over the dunes.  </p>
    <h2>why we Love Jaisalmer?</h2>
    <p>
        Right on the outskirts of Jaislmer, as you pass through the colourful villages, the golden desert awaits you. Spend a night on a desert Safari amidst shimmering sand dunes with us and you’ll see what the hype is about.
One thing that Jaisalmer can never fall short on is the royalty. The city offers you a rich experience of living in an actual 150-year-old fort,of course being a part of it! Riveting views of the city, golden-coloured houses in narrow lanes and the glistening desert- pretty much sums up what the fort life of Jaisalmer is like. 
Every Indian festival is celebrated here with togetherness. Be it the locals or travellers, all are welcome at the fort to participate in the festivities. And if you happen to celebrate Holi here, you’re lucky!

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>About 15 km from Jaisalmer, the abandoned village of Kuldhara weaves a mystery. The population here seems to have disappeared into thin air in the past, without leaving a trace behind. Today, it serves as a popular haunted spot for travellers. Curiosity brings them here to discover the mystery and eeriness of the ruins that are left behind.
        The present day Jaisalmer Fort was prophesied by Lord Krishna! Story goes that the king of Jaisalmer found a sage sitting on the present day site of the fort, who led him to a fountain. The fountain was supposedly a worship place for Lord Krishna and he carved the prophecy out on a stone. Now we’re not really sure about the accuracy of this claim, but it sure adds to the charm of the fort.
        As ancient as it is, the Jaisalmer Fort has incorporated one of the best drainage systems in those times. The focus was mainly to not waste water as it was and still is a valuable resource there- something that even modern-day drainage systems fail to do
