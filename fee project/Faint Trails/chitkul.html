    <h1>Welcome to Chitkul!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Perched up above most of India, in the Himalayas bordering Tibet, Chitkul is the kind of beauty that leaves you thoroughly awe-struck and grasping for more. The mountains here seem mightier than most other places, the air seems quieter, and life much slower. Coloured pink with Buckwheat blooms in Spring, white with thick blankets of snow in winters, and a shade of green & mountain brown in Summer, Chitkul is a delight like few others.  </p>
    <h2>why we Love Chitkul?</h2>
    <p>The shy and pretty traditional lifestyle of the villagers is one of the prime reasons travellers are intrigued by Chitkul. Considering it’s a refreshing change from the fast lifestyle of the city, diving into simplicity for a while is always welcomed.
        Chitkul also happens to be a gateway to some of the the most unexplored yet equally intriguing places in the Sangla Valley, one of them being Rakchham. Just 10 km from Chitkul, the outlandish bloom of Pink Olga blossoms greets you as you set foot here. 
        With a population of just 1000, Chitkul provides the perfect backdrop for a secluded holiday. And with literally no distractions around, you can focus on being lost in the ethereal natural beauty here, that deserves every bit of attention and then some more.

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Chitkul has a poor network, no hospital or ATM, and only 2 schools. This provides all travellers with the perfect opportunity to disconnect entirely and live the life from hundreds of years back, with the bare-minimum supplies and abundant nature all around.
        During Summers, Chitkul produces quality organic vegetables. Potatoes and peas grown here contribute to more than half of this village’s income and are also purest in their form. Travellers can relish basic and yet delicious home-cooked meals here, tasting the goodness in simplicity.
        Chitkul happens to be the last and highest human settlement on the old trade route between India and Tibet. The weather dynamics here change with utmost rapidity, making it an adventurous escape from monotony.
