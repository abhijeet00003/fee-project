    <h1>Welcome to Malana!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>World’s oldest democracy.Once upon a Time, secret, hermit village in Himachal Pradesh.
        From Kasol, Malana is about 21 km. A jeep carries you over the first 18 km, and then you trek uphill. But the
        climb up the frost-hardened slopes is still tough. At 8,700 feet, Malana is located on a narrow plateau, high on
        one side of a wild and remote glen that abuts the river Parvati in the Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh. The
        Malana Nullah, which flows through the valley, comes from Deotibba, the 20,000 feet, snow-covered peak that
        overhangs the glen and the village..

    <h2>Why we Love Malana?</h2>
    <p>If someone wants to seek some lone time adventuring,discovering as learning about the hidden. Malana: the lone
        black drongo calls from a leafless poplar. Deodhars rise in stately contrast against the dark grey mountains.
        The wind is placid but the cold is sharp. We are told it is six degrees below zero at Malana. The vegetation in
        Parvati Valley is sparse, the giant hillsides mostly bare. Except for a short summer spell, the valley is
        sunless and sombre. Parvati flows along a deep chasm over rocks and fallen boulders.

        The village administration is democratic and is believed, by locals, to be the oldest republic of the world.
        Despite being a part of the Kullu valley, there is a myth that the Malanis have very distinct physical features,
        and a dialect which is different from the rest of the valley. However, in the valleys of Himachal, there are a
        significant number of distinct Pahadi dialects, some of them totally different from each other. Hence the
        physical/lingual uniqueness cannot be proven, given the inaccessibility of the Malana people, except for the
        trade of Marijuana / Hashish in the Parvati valley. The village has several ancient temples.Jamlu temple, built
        in Kathkuni style, with wooden carving and deer heads Rukmini temple.

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>This overwhelming sense of seclusion is important to how the Malana community has evolved, shunning the outside
        world. A lonely existence in a tangle of high mountains meant that Malana once had total freedom, even from
        government. For very long, its villagers didn’t mingle with other Kullu villages; its village council didn’t
        recognise the role of the Indian state; it resisted all external influence.

        A Medal of Devotion and Esteem-Jamdagni Rishi is alleged to be the first to discover the gorgeous hilltop
        village of Malana in Kullu. In accordance to Hindu mythology and local legends, Lord Shiva endowed Jamdagni
        Rishi with Malana after his request for a place where he could venerate nature’s elegance.
        However, when Jamdagni Rishi drew closer to the Malana valley, he encountered Banasura, a giant mischievous
        spirit, who directed the entire region. In order to earn possession over the valley, Rishi challenged Banasura
        for a clash. However, the conflict ended in mutual conciliation and laid the foundation of an administration
        that was established on pillars of democracy and justice.

        Perceptible for its rich and inimitable culture, Malana is often termed as the little Greece in Malana. The
        villagers here claim to be the inhabitants of Greek ancestry. However, there is no convincing substantiation for
        the declaration. Malana also has a sacred treasure of customs and heritage unique to it. The only way the locals
        here can make merry is by means of festivals, which gives them a chance to dress in traditional attire, sing
        local folk songs and add color to the otherwise dull and monotonous life. They celebrate festivals throughout
        the year. Some of the prominent festivals include Badoh Mela, Fagdi Mela, etc.
