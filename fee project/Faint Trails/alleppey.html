    <h1>Welcome to Alleppey!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Frequent wisps of air soothing your senses, boatmen stories with their generations following the same age-old
        traditions, and a never-ending scent of local food filling narrow lanes of the city- Alleppey is one hell of an
        experience. Attractions like the Alappuzha Beach, brilliant orange and pink sunsets, and frequent snake boat
        races make Alleppey one of the most enthralling water towns in the list of a backpacker. </p>
    <h2>why we Love Alleppey?</h2>
    <p>A row through the calm canals and quaint paddy fields around the backwaters of Alappuzha take you back in time,
        as you take in all the green around you.
        The canal & backwater culture of Alleppey has won it the title of Venice of the East. When explored, these
        canals open up to tiny villages, with the residents leading simple & truly unique lives in the middle of the
        water.
        The popular Snake Boat Races of Alleppey are also the worldâ€™s largest team sport, with sometimes over 100
        participants rowing from a single boat. Can you imagine what a sight that would be?!

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Known for its stupendous backwaters, Alleppey offers its visitors the surreal experience of staying in a
        houseboat!
        Kuttanad, a region in Alleppey, is known to be the lowest village in India. It resides at the height of 1 to 3
        meters below sea level! The place often floods during the rainfall, so to adapt to this, the houses here are
        built to have no ground floors at all!
        There are entire villages on minuscule islands in the town of Alleppey. The residents use canoes to go from one
        place to another since there are no roads and only water all around!
