    <h1>Welcome to Bir!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>A mountain town with glimpses of chic cafes, paragliding, and green landscapes making it a travellers’ hub- this
        is Bir.
        The little town of Bir is adorned by a local population of Himachalis and Buddhists, artists that have found
        refuge in its green valleys, and adventure enthusiasts that are drawn to its charm. First things first, Bir is
        the best paragliding destination in India. Along with biking and hiking adventures, travellers love spending
        their days cafe-hopping and their nights catching fireflies. From local cafes that cover varying Indian and
        world cuisines to monasteries that soothe you with their pleasant colours, Bir sure is a sight for sore eyes and
        empty stomachs.
    </p>
    <h2>Why we love Bir?</h2>
    <p>India’s topmost paragliding destination, Bir welcomes you with incredible flight experience of 25-40 minutes.
        Travellers from across the country end up here to check the adventure off their bucket list.
        Sunsets hold a unique charm in the town of Bir. Every evening, nearly half the town gathers at the famous
        landing site to watch the golden sun go down. The unplanned gathering feels like a pure celebration, which is
        truly fulfilling & memorable.
        If mountains and great food is your kind of combo, Bir has a lot in store for you. The chic cafes with excellent
        views serve lip-smacking food, from contemporary vegan to traditional South Indian and more.
    </p>
    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>A lot of young entrepreneurs have permanently moved to Bir and made it their home. They now run their own cafes,
        hostels, and festivals. Dream-life, don’t you think?
        Bir is a dog-paradise! Most cafes have their own pet dogs, from gorgeous golden retrievers to cuddly
        street-adopted. If you’re a dog-lover, you’ve got to be here!
        The people of Bir are big-time believers and promoters of sustainable travel & living. They have their own
        garbage disposal and compost system, and strongly discourage littering amongst travellers.
