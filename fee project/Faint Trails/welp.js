// In this case problem will arise when we have to save 100  diff mobiles. In that situation we have to use the same properties again and again for 100 diff mobiles and we can copy and paste thye same piece of code repeatedly and we have to change the values of these properties every time for a particular mobile. So this is the inefficient way for tackling such kind of a problem Here, the cocept of objests comes into the picture . These objects help us to bundle these properties for atributes intto a single entity.

// function calling and declaration.
//case 1:
function catName(name){
    console.log("my cat name is " + name);
    }

catName("Tiger")


//case 2:(it'll run but a wrong practice)
catName("Chloe")
function catName(name){
    console.log("my cat name is " + name);
    }
//this result of code above is "My cat name is Chloe"

//ONLY DECLARATION ARE HOISTED
//java script only hoists the declaration, not initializations.If a variable is declared and initiated after using it , the value will be undefined. foe eg
//  console.log(num); returns undefined, as only declaration was hoisted, no initialization happens in this stage.

// if we perform function using expression that function won't be hoisted(type error)
// only normal functions are hoisted. 


//CONCLUSION
//Hoisting is not working in arrow function (refference error)
//Hoistiong is not working in function expression ( type error)
//Hoisting does not work when written with paranthesis (reference error)

  CLASS METHODS
   
  Static variable-- a static keyword is used to make a common memory space.

  >the static keyword defines a static method or property for a class.
  >static members are called without intantiating their clss and cannot be called through a class instance.
  >static methods are often used to create utility functions for ann application whereas ststic properties are useful for caches , fixed-configuration, or other data you dont need to be replicaed across instances.*/
