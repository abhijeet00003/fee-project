    <h1>UDAIPUR, RAJASTHAN</h1>

    <h1>Welcome to Udaipur!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Go back in time as you walk through the narrow lanes of streets and markets displaying not-so-narrow historical sites that left their mark on Udaipur. Be greeted by the cool breeze of the many lakes and explore the glory of the palaces. Try the Laal Maas or pyaaz kachori fondly enjoyed by the locals or dine in a lakeside cafe serving continental food. Udaipur is the land of opposites and intrigues travellers with its traditions, fitting right into the new-age practices.  </p>
    <h2>why we Love Udaipur?</h2>
    <p>The architectural excellence of Udaipur is no secret. Be it palaces in the middle of a lake, or the vernacular design of the royal homes, every traveller is bound to fall in love with the resplendence of this city.
        I don’t know about you but I haven’t met anyone who doesn’t like lakes. Rightfully called as the City of Lakes, Udaipur is sneaked by lakes in every major corner and they hugely contribute to its quaintness.
        Gangaur Festival
        Spring arrives in Udaipur with folk songs, dances, processions, and a lot of festivities. Celebrated for a fortnight in March, the highlight of Gangaur is the vibrant procession, where women make their way to the Pichola Lake with idols of Goddess Gauri.
        Beneshwar Fair
        Popularly known as the Kumbh Mela for tribals, Udaipur doesn’t seem to fall short on festivals for anyone. Beneshwar Mela overtakes the month of February with tribal rituals and thousands of devotees seek blessings of Lord Shiva.

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Udaipur has an interconnected lake system which regenerates the level of groundwater and regulates the climatic conditions by doing so. Who knew!
        The Dhebar lake situated here is officially the second-largest man-made lake in Asia, losing the title to the Veeranam lake in Tamil Nadu.
        Udaipur was supposedly the hotspot for zinc and copper minings in the ancient times. Although the mining was discontinued due to environmental reasons, Rajasthan still remains one of the prominent mining zones.
