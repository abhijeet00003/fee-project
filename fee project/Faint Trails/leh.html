    <h1>LEH, LADHAK </h1>

    <h1>Welcome to Leh!</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Roads that cut through a landscape of dark brown mountains, a sky that frequently blesses you with shooting stars, lakes that make you forget you’re in one of the most barren lands the country holds—the marvels of Ladakh are nonpareil. The bustling town of Leh invites travellers to try its food, witness its culture, and enjoy the tough Himalayan life, whereas the palaces, monasteries, and matchless views of Ladakh remind them how beauty prospers in India’s Northernmost parts. </p>
    <h2>why we Love Leh?</h2>
    <p>The roads that lead to Leh and further down to Nubra Valley or Pangong Lake are surreal to say the least. Garnered with rainbow mountains, a clear river flowing by the road, random patches of greenery and golden lands, and wild animals running untamed all make for a wonderful adventure. It is highly recommended to take all journeys with equal excitement, without falling asleep, to make the most of what Ladakh has to offer.
 
        With mesmerising places like Khardung La (the highest motorable pass in the world), Nubra Valley (with its double-humped camels and an enchanting desert), lakes of Pangong & Tso Moriri (they’re perfect, that’s where we leave that), and incredible villages like Hunder and Turtuk (cherries, blackberries, and peaches grow like weed here!), Ladakh is not just a place, it’s a full-fledged, crazy love affair.
         
        On a non-cloudy day, Leh, in fact, the entire of Ladakh makes for the perfect place to stargaze. Shooting star sightings are quite frequent and the movement of non-blinking stars, aka satellites is visible too, late in the night. In fact, if you drive a little away from the town, you may even spot the spine of the Milky Way!

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Sonam Wangchuk, an engineer and innovator who inspired the character of Rancho (Aamir Khan) in the Bollywood film 3 Idiots is known for his innovations and teachings in Leh. Making Solar mud buildings and ice stupas, his teaching campus of SECMOL achieves new feats of technological progress each year. It’s possible for travellers to visit the schools in selected hours every week.
 
        A festival brimming with colours, dances, and curious photographers and journalists from across the world, the Hemis Festival is a 2-day religious celebration in Buddhism. Marking the triumph of good over evil, the Chham Dance is performed by Buddhist Lamas of all ages, cladding pompous dresses and face masks depicting Gods and Devils. It takes place in the Hemis Monastery, a 1.5-hr drive from Leh.
         
        The air here is thinner due to the altitude, making even the least strenuous tasks feel like a huge undertaking. Climbing two-storey flights can leave you catching for breath, and a 10-minute walk uphill can easily leave you wanting for a break. It’s here, more than anywhere else, that you realise that nature is mightier than us all, after all. In all sincerity, come physically and mentally prepared and carry Diamox tablets!
