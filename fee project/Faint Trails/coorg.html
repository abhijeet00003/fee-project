    <h1>Welcome to Coorg!</h1>
    <h2> About</h2>
    <p> A land of refreshing waterfalls, mystical mountain tops, sprawling green landscapes, and
        a variety of flora and fauna that lives within it, Coorg is the textbook definition of a hill station. And like
        that’s not enough, Coorg happens to be home to coffee plantations, so you can only imagine the aroma of this
        place and the soothing effects it has!</p>
    <h2>Why we love Coorg?</h2>
    <p>The air of Coorg perennially stays fresh and fragrant, thanks to the abundant coffee, cardamom, and pepper
        plantations that bloom here. Another intrinsic smell is of the thick Deodars, which also add one more layer of
        green to its landscape.
        The many waterfalls and viewpoints of Coorg keep the explorer in you engaged and the time that you want to spend
        relaxing can gladly be dedicated to gazing at the greenery around or spotting stars in the night sky.
        To every adventurer’s delight, short hikes and treks adorn the land. Places such as Brahmagiri, Kumara Parvatha,
        Mullayanagiri, and Talacauvery are thus frequented by backpackers.

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>The Kodavas are the warrior tribe inhabiting the forestlands of Coorg, also known locally as Kodagu. They believe
        in guarding their land and produce and are still a major part of the population in Coorg
        Did you know that Coorg is one of Asia’s largest producers of honey? The authentic and elixir-like Virajpet
        Honey sells like hot cake in India as well as overseas!
        Kaveri Nisargadhama is a river island situated in Coorg. A government protected land, the lush green patch of
        the forest reserve is almost completely unexplored.
